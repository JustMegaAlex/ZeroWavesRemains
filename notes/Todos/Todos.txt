- непонятно что враг в волне
- не понял индикацию аммо
- загрузочный экран
- подсказки далеко, не сразу прочитал
- непонятно про магаз
- непонятно, что не хватает денег
- купил пули до покупки пушки
- трек немного надоедает
- написовать норм спрайты для магаза
- убил подсказки и не знал как переключить пушку
- не понял, что пульс восстанавливается 

Continue:

Higher difficulty playthrough:
- add more initial ammo
- more frequent drones, like every 2nd wave
- pulse is the most decent option, early scatter sucks and rarely has good application, snipe is ok

Future:
Enemies concepts:
> knife
    - small, melee, slams into a player
> leader
    - brings a swarm of knifes
    - super-throws knifes at you
> clunky
    - randomly flies around searching for the player
    - shoots mid-range very fast machine gun
    - limited shooting angle
    - dangerous if exposed to his guns
> sniper
    - sniper snipes from long range
    - average damage
    - if player is too close for some time gains distance
> fighter 2.0
    - burst blaster
    - missiles
> frigate
    - lots of missiles ?



Ideas:
> ship weight system: more equipment = less agile
    - drop weapons on the go to move faster
> choose color palette?
> add flaring red effect when < 25% hp
> penetrating kinetic weapon (like that bugged out pulse)
> replace ammo with ammo upgrades: restore ratio + amount
> upd scatter and snipe: autorestore ammo
> killing spree: add kill combo timer


One sentence pitch:
"Zero Waves Remains is a twin-stick shooter where decisions beat precision"

Enemy concepts:
> mosquito: you can't kite forever
    - kite-shooting you
    - on distance enters sniper mode: unescapable shot
> rework behemoth: makes you constantly change location
    - rotating big gun
> tiny swarms: makes you use scatter or explosives
    - can be one shoted with pulse
    - large numbers: pulse ineffective
> goblin: very annoying, really asks to get wrecked with seeker missiles
    - actively evades your shots
    - gains distance very fast
    - fast bullets are hard to evade
Mechanics:
> big rocket
    - one shot
    - choose who you just want to delete
> enemy seeker missiles
    - almost unescapable
    - pushes into using shield
> emp weapons
    - disables shields
    - partially disables systems (slows down, messes up weapons)
